# Dotify

Simple Spotify clone for iOS

## About

Dotify is a Spotify-clone app that can do the following tasks:
- Homepage features songs, featured albums, favorite genres. User can choose songs to directly listen to, or jump to featured albums and genres for a list of songs that belong to the group.
- A functional in-app music player with basic functions: Play, Pause, Stop, change volume, change song, toggle shuffle, toggle repeat.
- Login function: Users can sign up an account for free and use that account to favorite songs or make custom playlists.

## Installation

Clone the project, then run the workspace with Xcode. Minimum Xcode version required is 10.2.

## Status

Since the project has long gone under hiatus, it has several issues with Firebase database being outdated and expired. Therefore data have been compromised and thus inoperatable. Working on migrating to other Firebase database as a solution.
